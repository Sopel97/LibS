# LibS

This is a personal header only library for C++17.
It provides common geometrical shapes (both 2 and 3 dimensional), simple linear algebra for 3d games (matrices, quaternions, vectors), random distributions over shapes, noise generation, multidimensional arrays, simple opengl wrapper, simple json parser, collision detection (also continuous collision detection for some shapes), generic 2d cellular automaton, poisson disc samplers over arbitrary distribution, wang tile sets and generation of fitting tiles, probabilistic sequence generator based on Markov chains, and more.

Features are being made when needed. Some things are declared but not implemented yet.
Some parts of code are adapted from solutions that can be openly found on the internet. I try to note the original author but it's not done everywhere yet.
